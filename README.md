Welcome to the Image Carousel Project repository! This project consists of a responsive website that displays an image carousel and a photo gallery.

## Other Languages

- [Versão em Português](README_pt-BR.md)

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: The project utilizes HTML to structure the content of the web page, including header, body, image carousel, photo gallery, and footer.

- **CSS**: The CSS files (`style.css` and `media-query.css`) provide styles for the HTML elements, ensuring visually appealing appearance and consistent user experience across different devices and screen sizes. It uses media queries to make the site responsive.

- **JavaScript**: JavaScript is used to implement the functionality of the image carousel. The JavaScript code controls the transition of images in the carousel, allowing them to slide automatically. It also dynamically adjusts the width of the carousel based on the browser window size.

## Project Structure

The project is structured into three main components:

1. **HTML**: The HTML file (`carrossel.html`) defines the structure of the web page.

2. **CSS**: The CSS files (`style.css` and `media-query.css`) provide styles for the HTML elements.

3. **JavaScript**: The JavaScript file (`script.js`) controls the dynamic behavior of the image carousel.
